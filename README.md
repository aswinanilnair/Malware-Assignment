# Malware Assignment 1- UE18CS347

This assignment was part of the course **Information Security (UE18CS347)**. 

The objective was to convert a given virus into a worm by taking clues from:
- [AbraWorm.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aswinanilnair/Malware-Assignment/main/AbraWorm.py)
- [FooVirus.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aswinanilnair/Malware-Assignment/main/FooVirus.py)

The files listed above were originally written by: Avinash Kak @ Purdue

The solution to the assignment is in [FooWorm.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aswinanilnair/Malware-Assignment/main/FooWorm.py) which is to be run on the attacker's machine. I have indicated the places to make changes in the file in order to make it work on your machine. I have used the [Ubuntu 16.04 32-bit SEED labs pre-built VM](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) for this assignment.

## Prerequisites 
The Attacker and Victim machines need to have paramiko and scp installed for the attack to work correctly.
    `sudo apt-get update -y`
    `sudo apt-get install -y python-paramiko`
    `sudo apt-get install -y python-scp`
